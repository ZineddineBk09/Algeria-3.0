# Crypto/E-learning platform:

Main Ideas:

- Website visiter should first be greeted with a landing page that explains what's Algeria3.0 and it's founder Djamal Khalfaoui (founder).
  - What's algeria 3.0?
    - What's web3.0, what's algeria 3.0 and it's goal
    - Example 01 (generic): "Algeria 3.0 is a platform that aims to educate Algerians about the blockchain technology and it's potential to revolutionize the world."
    - Example 02 (specific): "Algeria 3.0 is a platform that aims to educate Algerians about the blockchain technology and it's potential to revolutionize the world. It's founder Djamal Khalfaoui is a blockchain expert and a digital marketer that has been working in the field for over 10 years."
    - Example (brief/to the point): "in Algeria 3.0 we Educate you, we Invest with you, and we win together."
  - The founder (Djamal Khalfaoui)
    - Use the photos, relations, collaborations, details about how he started the project and his vision, achievements, etc. 
    - A special sections for events and collaboration and tag them where each event/person can be clicked to display more details. (website, pictures, etc.).
    - Example : "Djamal Khalfaoi is a blockchain expert and a digital marketer that has been working in the field for over 10 years. He has worked with multiple companies and has helped them grow their business using blockchain technology."
  - Design wise the landing page should be simple and clean, with a big hero section that contains 2 tabs (one for the founder and one for the platform).
- Website should include animations that helps the visiter continue reading and exploring the website.
